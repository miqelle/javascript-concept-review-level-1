JavaScript Review 1 - Functions and Loops
This 5 challenge review covers core JavaScript concepts and is expected to take Students 1.5 hr or less

Directions
Create a new public GitHub repository called javascript-concept-review-level-1
Clone repository and copy the contents of this README file to your README
Create index.html,style.css, and main.js files in your project
Code your answers to each of the 5 questions using the Standard JavaScript Template described below:
NOTE: Start with a separate JavaScript file with a function called main(). This should be the first function called and point of entry for execution. All other code to accomplish whatever challenge should be in it's own function called from the main() function. No JavaScript code should execute outside of a function. This pattern should be considered our 'Standard JavaScript Template' for all exercises.

main() {
    // call exercise1()
    // call excercise2()
    // etc.
}
Before you type ANY CODE, write out your steps to solve each exercise in each file. Use single line comments to pseudocode what you need to do to solve the problem then fill in the blanks.

// JUST AN EXAMPLE!
// Create an array
// Load objects into the array
// Iterate through each element in the array and print the element
1. Integer Numbers Range
Write a function in Javascript that takes two integer parameters x1 and x2 returns all the integers between them. If x2 is lower than x1 it should return -1. Provide appropriate User feedback.

2. Multiplications table
Write a function that writes in the console or browser the multiplication table (from 1 to 10)

multiplication

3. Multiplications table on demand
Write a function that writes in the console or browser a multiplication table (in one column) of any number passed as parameter.

4. Calculations and Operators
Write a program that writes in the console or browser all the multiples of 23 less than 500 and at the end writes the sum of all of them. PRO TIP: Google the % (modulus) operator on how you can use it to determine the numbers divisible by 23.

Elements : 0 23 46 69 92 115 138 161 184 207 230 253 276 299 322 345 368
391 414 437 460 483
Sum : 5313
5. Write Your Own max() function
Define a function max() that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. Use the if-then-else construct available in Javascript. Provide appropriate User feedback.
